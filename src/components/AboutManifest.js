                     We make AI accessible, serving Machine Learning related 
                    technologies to individuals and businesses of all sizes 
                    quite flexible. Unlike common belief, we believe that AI 
                    will create more employment over time, and we are a part of
                     it. AI needs human culture to grow, and we collect the 
                     required dataset while employing a wide variety of people. W
                     e insist every product of AI must be an Intelligent Agent instea
                     d of a tool. We must add features to let agents learn from any d
                     ata they can access and relate to its mission. Currently, rebuil
                     ding all tools as agents means a lot of time and effort. So our solution
                      is IAAAS or AAIAAS (Intelligent Agent as a Service or Automated AI as a Ser
                      vice). We can compare IAAAS to adding the Frontal lobe to a reptilian brain we t
                      
                      ried to illustrate in our logo. Our ultimate goal is to tr
                      ansfer human intelligence to non-biological 
                      hosts and create digital life forms. This
                       seems the only way to intelligent continue to exp
                       lore this rapidly growing universe and continue search
                       ing for self.
