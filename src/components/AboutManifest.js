                    </h5>
                    <article>
                    <p>Our mission is to make AI accessible, serving Machine Learning related 
            technologies to individuals and businesses of all sizes quite flexible so that 
            people do not need to create their own AI tools to benefit from machine learning 
            algorithms.<br></br></p>
	        
            <p>
            Unlike common belief we believe that AI will create more employment over time and it already <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artificial-intelligence-is-creating-jobs-dun--bradstreet-survey-finds-300774141.html" target="_blank"> reached 40% </a>among organizations.
            AI needs human culture
              to grow, and we create the 
            required datasets while employing a wide variety of people.<br></br></p>
            <p>
	We will start a new era where artificial intelligence will be at your service 
            without you worrying about how to learn and use these algorithms. Our intelligent 
            agents will be able to aid companies and businesses without differentiating between 
            domains.<br></br></p><p>So far, the use of AI was at the hand of either big tech companies or 
            people who had the resources to create their own AI systems. It is estimated that <a href="https://connect.comptia.org/content/research/emerging-business-opportunities-in-ai" target="_blank">only 29% of companies use AI</a> regularly.
            Because they only used AI as a tool, 
            which means that these algorithms only worked to solve specific problems in domains they were trained for.<br></br></p> 
	<p>On the other hand, intelligent agents are a much stronger concept where AI can now take actions 
            and make decisions independently, without being given direct commands on its output. 
            They must learn from any data they can access and relate to its tasks. All you have to do is 
            give an intelligent agent an environment of your own choice (regarding your business). The intelligent agent will start to learn and improve it.<br></br>
	Currently, rebuilding all tools as agents involves a lot of time and effort. So our solution 
    is IAAAS or AAIAAS (Intelligent Agent as a Service or Automated AI as a Service). We can compare 
    IAAAS to adding the Frontal lobe to a reptilian brain, as we tried to illustrate in our logo. <br></br></p><p>
    We create intelligent agents that will understand your businesses’ flow and help you organize and optimize your products and processes.
	One of our greatest goals is to benefit from intelligent agents using their maximum potential. 
    Automat-able tasks should be detected, implemented, and executed by intelligent agents to 
    maximize the business’s efficiency and decrease the need for any human labor. 
    <br></br></p><p>Our ultimate 
    goal is to transfer human intelligence to non-biological hosts and create digital life forms. 
    This seems the only way to intelligent continue to explore this rapidly growing universe and continue searching for self.
