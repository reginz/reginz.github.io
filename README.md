Redirect navigates to new location
AnchorLink,HashLink navigates same page with scroll -> import AnchorLink from 'react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll';
HashLink -> import { HashLink } from 'react-router-hash-link';
I wanted to do if naviagation item is in other page navigate with <Redirect>, else with <AnchorLink>, couldn't find such method. Maybe we can do it by creating a function but I couldn't do it.
