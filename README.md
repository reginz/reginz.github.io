Redirect navigates to new location<br>
AnchorLink,HashLink navigates same page with scroll -> import AnchorLink from 'react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll';<br>
HashLink -> import { HashLink } from 'react-router-hash-link';<br>
I wanted to do if naviagation item is in other page navigate with Redirect, else with AnchorLink, couldn't find such method. Maybe we can do it by creating a function but I couldn't do it.<br>
